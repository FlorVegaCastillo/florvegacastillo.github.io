 Montana State University celebrated its 100th annual Day of Student Recognition, where the university awarded students and groups in five categories: Legacy, Service, Leadership, Teaching & Mentorship, and Academics & Research. I'm thrilled to announce that I obtained the Spirit Outstanding Student Award - "Student who embodies leadership, citizenship, and involvement" (Service).

 Being a full-time graduate student, a graduate assistant in one of the core departments of MSU, like the Graduate School, president of the [First-Generation Students Association](https://www.instagram.com/msu_firstgenerationstudents/) and vice president of United Nations Association of the United States of America (UNA-USA) Bozeman chapter, a volunteer mentor for the [Thrive's](https://allthrive.org/) (non-profit organization) Child Advancement Project and a volunteer at the MSU Diversity and Inclusion Student Commons is helping me to discover my full potential.

Thanks to the generosity of MSU offices, departments, and allies in the MSU community, we were able to host:
- Tabling events in student resource and student engagement fairs
- Professional development workshops with cross-departamental speakers
- Admissions webinars in partnership with the Admissions office
- The First-Gen week in partnership with MSU's offices
Among other initiatives.
