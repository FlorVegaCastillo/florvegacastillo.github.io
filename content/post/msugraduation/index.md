 I completed the Boardroom Bobcat Program, a program run by the MSU Leadership Institute that seeks to connect students with the Bozeman community and earn hands-on experience in the nonprofit industry. I got matched with [Bienvenidos at Gallatin Valley](https://bienvenidosgv.org/) and worked along them as a Board member for ten months. MSU News Services created [an article](https://www.montana.edu/news/24486/ten-montana-state-students-complete-year-of-service-on-local-nonprofit-boards) about my cohort and our results.

 My role at Bievenidos started as Chair of the Advisory Board Committee, where Spanish-speaking family representatives will come together and share their thoughts on different topics. The goal was for the Board to better understand the individuals we served and their needs. Finally, I proposed a new re-branding of their onboarding package, alligned with their revamped branding and finding multiple uses for it.

This was a unique experience that provided me with valuable lessons about serving in a non-profit as a Board member.
