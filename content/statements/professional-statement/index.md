When I look back and see myself as a 13-year-old teenager searching for 10-cent coins on the sidewalks on my way back home from school, **I reflect on the role education and timely access to information have played in my life.** Now, I am a driven communications professional with almost 10 years of experience in the public and private sectors in Peru and the United States. I combined a mix of an unconditional commitment to my undergraduate studies to obtain scholarships, and additional coursework as continuing education to get better job opportunities. Learning a second language and going through English proficiency tests. Overall ongoing hard work, long shifts at initial jobs, and other types of investments towards my future knowing that things would eventually get better. 

As a result, I have relevant experience working in recognized organizations in the public sector, including a public institution in telecommunications research and higher education recruitment and admissions as well as an academic support center, and the private sector. Due to my time management skills acquired at a young age, I developed a strong capacity to manage different assigned duties and projects and deliver effective results satisfying set deadlines. All while continuously training myself with additional courses when I was in Peru and being involved in leadership positions while studying for my two master’s degrees in the United States. They also helped me to **be aware of different groups’ needs to serve them better and uplift their capacity to achieve their best self.** 

At each of my current and past workplaces, I have strived to create and maintain solid professional relationships based on mutual respect, collaboration, and mentorship when applicable. I believe in everyone’s potential to offer valuable insights, especially those in the early stages of their career. I can proudly say that I meet my team’s expectations while having a great attitude and I’ll be happy to tell you more about it on a phone call or video call.
