## About Me

Hi! My name is Flor Vega Castillo. I'm a Master in Public Administration student at Montana State University,USA.
I hold an MSc in Public Relations from Montana State University - Billings, USA, and a BSc in Communication Sciences from Cesar Vallejo University, Peru.
With nearly a decade of experience in communications and a solid background in community outreach, content development, relationship and community building and public services popularization, I believe there are always new ways to connect at a deeper and more meaningful level.
