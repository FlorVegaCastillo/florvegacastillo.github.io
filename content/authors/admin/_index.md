      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

Hi! My name is Flor Vega Castillo. I'm a Master in Public Administration student at Montana State University.
I hold an MSc in Public Relations from Montana State University - Billings, USA, and a BSc in Communication Sciences from Cesar Vallejo University, Peru.
With nearly a decade of experience in communications and a solid background in community outreach, content development, relationship and community building and public services popularization, I believe there are always new ways to connect.
