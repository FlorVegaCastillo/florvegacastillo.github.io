summary: Montana Conservation Corps Program Evaluation - Alumni Career Outcomes Survey Evaluation Report
abstract: 'The Montana Conservation Corps (MCC) serves hundreds of young adults each year by engaging them in hands-on conservation efforts across Montana. As interns, field crew members, and program or field leaders, individuals gain career-advancing skills while bolstering leadership and civic engagement through service (Montana Conservation Corps, 2024). This evaluation focused primarily on measuring the career outcomes and aspirations of MCC adult programming alumni. This was the final project for the PSCI 559 Program Evaluation class.'
