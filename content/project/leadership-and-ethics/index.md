summary: Leadership and Ethics term paper - Cooperation and coordination across MSU to better understand and serve international graduate studentsâ€™ academic and career opportunities
abstract: 'The final paper for the PSCI 520 Leadership and Ethics course led me to ask "How can MSU administrators cooperate and collaborate to better serve students with such invaluable career development, research advancement, and networking opportunities when the other on-campus and off-campus resources are not suitable for graduates or international students? How other offices and programs can come up with a plan to create bridges for underrepresented students through affirmative action, better budgeting allocation, and organizational slack knowing those studentsâ€™ needs for their academic and professional development?"'
