In previous [MSU Grad Fair](https://www.montana.edu/gradschool/admissions/grad-fairs/msu-grad-fair.html) editions, the Graduate School hosted virtual sessions; however, this time we also had an in-person component. In addition to two days of virtual sessions dedicated to international applicants (three per day) and one virtual session for U.S.-based applicants, we also hosted an in-person fair, with 24 MSU departments and five Montana university graduate schools participating (listed below). 

- An average of 120 attendees joined the six international sessions 
- Approximately 80 attendees participated in the U.S.-based virtual session.
- Around 100 attendees came to the in-person Grad Fair.

I took a primary role in organizing, advertising, and hosting. Here are some of the tasks:

**Logistics:**  
●Booked the venue, designed the setup, and coordinated catering orders.  
●Recruited and coordinated speakers and panelists for the in-person sessions.  
●Worked with the Office of International Programs to arrange hosts for the international virtual sessions.  
●Created a new design for the slides used during the info sessions and an auto-play presentation for the in-person fair, as well as the virtual sessions.  
●Developed welcome packets for booth representatives.   
●Created personalized name tags.  

**Advertisement:**   
♦Worked with University Communications to assess and refine the design materials.  
♦Executed social media posts and stories.  
♦Distributed event graphics through MSU's digital outlets (screens in housing residences and dining halls, newsletters, event calendars, and announcements).  
♦Coordinated a local radio Public Service Announcement (PSA).  
♦Organized and attended tabling opportunities to increase event awareness.  
♦Connected with student organizations to help promote the event.  
♦Created content for the event website.  
♦Drafted a press release for potential publication or news article creation.  
♦Photo coverage on the day of the event.  

**Emailing:**    
▪️Wrote engaging emails and text messages to students in their second, third, and fourth years through the NavMSU platform.  
▪️Revised automated emails to be sent to prospective students who registered for the sessions.  
▪️Drafted invite emails for departments to forward to their prospective students.  
▪️Communicated with speakers, panelists, and booth representatives, including session-specific details and reminders.  

This event was possible thanks to my colleagues in the Recruitment and Admissions unit at The Graduate School at Montana State University: Melis Edwards, Danica Lower, Taylor Hophan-Nichols, Mackenzie Williams, and Nirvair Singh Khosa. 

Thanks for joining MSU Billings, Montana Technological University, University of Montana, University of Providence and Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine.
