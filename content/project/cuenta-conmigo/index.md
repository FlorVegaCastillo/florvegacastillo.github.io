*Cuenta Conmigo* (Count on Me) started from a personal experience I had in 2020. My two younger cousins, one aged 16 and the other 15, had multiple questions and doubts about what major choose. They were in that stage in high school when the pressure to select the career that will define your future starts. The uncertainty was multiplied by the fear and discomfort the Covid pandemic brought. We met online regularly and I helped them navigate the basics so that they could make a more informed decision. They both got into college majors they were truly interested in conducting. 

However, after starting my master's in public relations program in the U.S., I kept following the News in Peru. The high school students were highly affected because not all the communities (rural and urban) across the country were prepared to attend online classes because of the lack of equipment or overall guidance. Their parents would search for alternatives to substain their health and food needs, but they were mostly left alone. In that scenario, where the present is so uncertain and sad, how could they "dare to" think about their future? That led me to think of what could I do to help mitigate the lack of information and boost their motivation.

I contacted two friends, one communications science professional and one psychologist. I met them both in-person only once (until this day) but we kept a great relantionship through social media. Our values were very alligned and both fell instantly connected to the idea. That's how after initial group virtual meetings, *Cuenta Conmigo* was created. We started with our mission, objectives, SWOT analysis and then we created our branding package. Other connections were made with who we would call our allies, other Peruvian professionals living in different countries, to share their own stories in higher education.

We offered:
- Guidance in the high school students' (14-17 years old) higher education decision-making process.
- Professionals' testimonials and recommendations about their careers for the students to consider.
- A Life Project Manual we created for students to fill, take notes during the sessions, and go back to whenever in doubt.
- A complete self-assessment to discover their strenghts, interests, and goals for a more confident decision.
- An eight-session online workshop where we would present slides with rich information, break-out sessions, Q&As, and a Google classroom for the submission of their assingments.
- We did not tell students what/where to study, or conducted a vocational test because we believed in their capacity to make a decision by the end of the workshop.

We ended up having three online workshops, serving 65 high school students from different regions. Our recruitment process was open to all students within those ages, and we were flexible in the assingment submissions (typed, scanned, printed or handwritten). We shared the stories of professionals in three different formats: edited testimonal videos, written interviews as posts, and live interviews. There were in total 17 allies from Peru and then I included the testimonial of two American students with subtitles in Spanish.
