*Cuenta Conmigo* (Count on Me) started from a personal experience I had in 2020. My two younger cousins, one aged 16 and the other 15, had multiple questions and doubts about what major choose. They were in that stage in high school when the pressure to select the career that will define your future starts. The uncertainty was multiplied by the fear and discomfort the Covid pandemic brought. We met online regularly and I helped them navigate the basics so that they could make a more informed decision. They both got into college majors they were truly interested in conducting. 

However, after starting my master's in public relations program in the U.S., I kept following the News in Peru. The high school students were highly affected because not all the communities (rural and urban) across the country were prepared to attend online classes because of the lack of equipment or overall guidance. Their parents would search for alternatives to substain their health and food needs, but they were mostly left alone. In that scenario, where the present is so uncertain and sad, how could they "dare to" think about their future?
