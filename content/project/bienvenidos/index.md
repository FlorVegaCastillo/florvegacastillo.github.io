summary: Independent Study - Lessons learned with Bienvenidos
abstract: 'This is the final paper I submitted for the Independent Study class (PSCI 592). I described my findings as a Board Member for Bienvenidos, and I do so from my public administration graduate student, my public relations practitioner, and my own Latina identity perspective. However, I emphasized the theory learned through all these semesters in the MPA program. Because I also believe we cannot divide ourselves into different ‚Äúhats,‚Äù I write this paper wearing all of them.'
