As an end-of-the-semester event, the UNA-USA Montana State University-Bozeman Chapter and the Office of International Programs are hosting "Building Bridges," to happen on April 27 and 28. 

[MSU News Services wrote this article](https://www.montana.edu/news/22844/montana-state-hosts-building-bridges-event-to-foster-cross-cultural-dialogue) with all the details about this unique and significant opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to learn more about best practices and research on sustainability, and international graduate students from diverse majors' work and their relationship with sustainable development goals. We will also have speakers from different countries to share surprising information about their cultures and experiences.

A short quote from the article:

“We believe that this event will portray not only the importance of core topics like sustainability but also how these are seen and portrayed through the lenses of MSU students from different countries but also from diverse majors,” said Flor Vega-Castillo, the vice president of MSU’s chapter of the United Nations Association and an international graduate student from Peru. “I will be leading the panel of MSU graduate students from North and South America, Western Asia, South Asia, and West Africa, and I am very excited about hearing from them and learning how their experiences and aspirations align with some (Sustainable Development Goals).”

This is another instance where I find myself truly enjoying the many other aspects of higher education and how public administration and public relations (both my majors) are connected in magnificent ways. I was responsible for:
- Developed media management strategies, wrote press releases and served as one of the spokespeople for this event.
- Arranged the panelists line-up for the first day of the event and moderated the panel discussion.
- Ensured logistic needs were covered, including A/V tech and catering.
- Ordered and acquired of the incentives for the panelists, and speakers through UNA-USA.
- Created and organized the slideshows shown at both days of the event while keeping consistent communication with the speakers and co-organizers.
- Shared my lived multicultural experiences in the second day of the event and engaged into deeper conversations during the reception.
