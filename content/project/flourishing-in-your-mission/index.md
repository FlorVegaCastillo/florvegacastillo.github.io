summary: Flourishing in Your Mission - Program Proposal and Implementation Plan
abstract: 'This program implementation plan was our final project for PSCI591 - Program Planning and Development. This detailed the findings and recommendations from an analysis of a community issue and a corresponding proposed programmatic solution to address the concerns. I proposed a new program to support international graduate students both once accepted to their programs and during their first year.'
